## Usage 

*	Create a file in your repository named .gitignore
*	Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit. 
*	A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

## Gitignore Pattern Format

* A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
* A line starting with `#` serves as a comment.
* An optional prefix `!` which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. If a negated pattern matches, this will override lower precedence patterns sources.
* If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the following description, but it would only find a match with a directory. In other words, `foo/` will match a directory `foo` and paths underneath it, but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link `foo` (this is consistent with the way how pathspec works in general in git).
* If the pattern does not contain a slash `/`, git treats it as a shell glob pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location of the `.gitignore` file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not from a `.gitignore` file).
* Otherwise, git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption by fnmatch(3) with the `FNM_PATHNAME` flag: wildcards in the pattern will not match a `/` in the pathname. For example, `Documentation/*.html` matches `Documentation/git.html` but not `Documentation/ppc/ppc.html` or `tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html`.
* A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example, `/*.c` matches `cat-file.c` but not `mozilla-sha1/sha1.c`.
